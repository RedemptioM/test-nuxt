      I have completed all the requirements. I didn't create error handling
      methods and pages due to limited time as currently I'm also in a
      programming competition on top of working. There is some auto-generate
      code which has no effect to the result, so I just leave it there. Sorry
      about that. Nuxt is good, I learned a lot from this task, thank you guys.
